   chunk
      Each dataset is consisting of a number of chunks that store objects whose hash id starts with the same characters (and matches the chunk's chunk id).

   chunk count
      total number of chunks in a dataset, valid numbers: 16, 256, 4096.

   chunk id
      1-2-3 character hexadecimal number in string format depending on the chunk count of a dataset. All objects whose hash is starting with the chunk id must be in the chunk identified by the chunk id.

   delayed
      At execution each task is pickled and a copy of it is created in the thread. If a class cannot be pickled it cannot be a member of task before execution. :class:`.Delayed` solves this problem by delaying the creation recursively until the execution in the thread starts

   hash
      40 digit hexadecimal value generated with SHA1 method.

   hash id
      fields of a domain object can be used to find out which chunk the object will be in a dataset.

   id
      fields that uniquely identify an object. Two objects deemed equal if their id's mathch.
