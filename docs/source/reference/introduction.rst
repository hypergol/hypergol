.. currentmodule:: hypergol

The structure of Hypergol is organised around two functions: Core functionalities that enable running Hypergol projects and code generating scripts that generate those projects.

Hypergol Data Model
-------------------

Hypergol project's domain data model is described by a set of classes that all derive from :class:`BaseData`. This provdes the basic functionalities that enable the class to interoperate with the rest of the framework.

:class:`BaseData`
    Hello world

Datasets
--------

This is another cool topic, write here about the interoperation of classes in dataset.py.

Here is a bunch of link (the first works, get permalink where you want to link and cut the beginning)
`Dataset <classes.html#dataset-class-for-storing-domain-objects>`__,
:doc:`DatasetWriter </reference/classes/dataset_writer>`,
:doc:`DatasetReader </reference/classes/dataset_reader>`,


Tasks
-----

There are three types of tasks: :class:`Source`, :class:`SimpleTask`, :class:`Task`.
